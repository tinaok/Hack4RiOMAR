    "# Transform Odysea data to DGGS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "ODYSEA (Ocean DYnamics and Surface Exchange with the Atmosphere) is a proposed French-U.S. satellite \n",
    "mission designed to study wind-ocean surface interactions. Developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and CNES, ODYSEA aims to provide critical insights into the dynamics of ocean-atmosphere exchanges, enhancing our understanding of Earth's climate system. The mission has been proposed for NASA’s Earth System Explorers Announcement of Opportunity (AO), highlighting its potential to advance oceanographic and atmospheric research.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these types of remote sensing data offer excellent coverage, there are still gaps in the data that need to be addressed. Additionally, the data is complex due to overlaps, and each scan corresponds to a slightly different time based on the satellite's track.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Access, open and prepare the Odysea sample dataset as a xarray datatree\n",
    "- Transform the Odysea dataset into DGGS Healpix\n",
    "- Save thetransformed dataset in Zarr\n",
    "- Visualize the transformed dataset with `xdggs`\n",
    "\n",
